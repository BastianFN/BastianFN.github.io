    <h1>Privacy Policy for RKG App</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April 10, 2024</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information collected,
      used, and shared when you use the RKG app, developed for RusKursusGruppen
      members at University of Copenhagen. Our app aims to enhance the connection and
      engagement within the RKG community by providing features such as song
      texts, a directional compass, and event calendars specifically tailored
      for our members.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      The RKG app collects and uses location data to enable the compass feature,
      which points towards a specific statue on campus and activates a text
      display and song playback when directed accurately. This data is collected
      automatically upon accessing the compass feature, with location access
      permissions requested from the user as per device requirements (iOS).
      Heading information is collected automatically. No other personal
      information is collected by our app.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong>
      The sole purpose of collecting this information is to enable the compass
      feature within the app. No location or heading data is stored, retained,
      or used for any other purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      The RKG app does not store, share, or disclose any data it collects to
      third parties. Since the app does not retain any data, disclosure to
      authorities or other entities without user consent does not apply.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Rights and Data Management</h2>
    <p>
      Users have full control over their location data. To discontinue sharing
      location information with the RKG app, users can disable location services
      for the app through their device's settings. As no data is stored or
      retained by the app, no further action is required to manage or delete
      data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      The RKG app does not store any user data, thereby significantly minimizing
      any risk of unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. International Use</h2>
    <p>
      The RKG app is designed to operate internationally. However, as it does
      not store or process data, issues related to international data transfer
      and jurisdiction are not applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The RKG app is not intended for children under the age of 13. It is
      designed for use by university students and alumni of RusKursusGruppen.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy at any time. Changes
      will be notified through the "What's new" section of the app update and
      the updated policy will be accessible at
      <a href="https://bastianfn.github.io/">https://bastianfn.github.io/</a>
      .
